        <h3 class="first-txt">Origami is derived from two Japanese words: Ori (folded) and Kami (paper). Before that, the art was called
            “orikata” (folded shapes).<br>
            An ancient Japanese legend says if you fold one thousand cranes you will be granted a wish.
            <br>Origami is the traditional Japanese game of folding elaborately designed paper into a myriad of shapes,
            typically plants, animals, and other living things. <br>
            Part of what makes origami unique is the fact that it simply requires a piece of paper and a creative
            imagination.
